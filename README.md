# HOMEWORK: Weather App!!!

Wait a second... I think I've heard that before...

Yup! You've built a weather app already, BUT tonight you will rebuild it using REACT! ðŸ˜‰

### Open Weather API

Hopefully you remember working with the [Open Weather Map API](http://openweathermap.org/api). If you don't, check out the [original readme](https://github.com/WDI-HoneyBadger/hw-w07d03-fetch-weather-2).


## Completion looks like:

Your app has multiple components and does the following things:

- Handles the zip code input from the user
- Fetches data from the API when the zip code is submitted
- Parses the information that comes back from the API call
- Renders that information on the page
- **BONUS**: Include the sunrise and sunset times (hint: maybe [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) will be helpful!) and some information about humidity, atmospheric pressure, etc.

Things to think about:

- What components do you need?
- Should your app have state?
- How/when would you change state?
- What way will you make the API call?

**Map out your components, state and props before you start!**

## This homework is due ðŸš¨ TOMORROW AT 9AM ðŸš¨
